## Install

Babel and webpack are required if not already installed:

`npm install -g babel-cli webpack`

By default a basic `http-server` is used in the `npm run dev` script. Odds are that it won't be for long but if you'd like to get it running with no extra work:

`npm install -g http-server`

One last `npm install` and you're good to go :)
